 2.1. Grants
 Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
 license:
 .
 (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
 Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify,
 display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either

 (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
 have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its

 .
 2.2. Effective Date
 The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
 effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
 such Contribution.
 .
 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
 The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
 License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
 or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:
 .
 (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
 .
 (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
 modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions
 with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or
 .
 (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
 Contributions.
 .
 This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
 logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice
 requirements in Section 3.4).
 .
 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
 No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute
 the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section
 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms
 of Section 3.3).
 .
 2.5. Representation
 Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are
 its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its
 Contributions conveyed by this License.
 .
 2.6. Fair Use
 This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
 copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
 .
 2.7. Conditions
 Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
 Section 2.1.
 .
 3. Responsibilities
 .
 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
 terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of
 the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can
 obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the
 recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.
 .
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 .
 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as
 described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form
 how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a
 timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the
 recipient; and
 .
 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or
 sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the
 Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in
 the Source Code Form under this License.
 .
 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
 Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
 a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is
 not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
 additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary
 License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,
 further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License
 or such Secondary License(s).
 .
 3.4. Notices
 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
 copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
 liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,
 except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy
 known factual inaccuracies.
 .
 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
 or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
 However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
 Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
 indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
 agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
 Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
 offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
 liability specific to any jurisdiction.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
 with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
 order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
 to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
 they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
 distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent
 prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
 detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 .
 5. Termination
 .
 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
 fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then
 the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
 reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and
 finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such
 Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
 prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your
 grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such
 Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this
 is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your
 receipt of the notice.
 .
 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and
 cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
 infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all
 Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall
 terminate.
 .
 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
 license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
 validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
 termination shall survive termination.
 .
 6. Disclaimer of Warranty
 Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
 warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
 without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
 merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk
 as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should
 any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor)
 assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This
 disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of
 any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this
 disclaimer.
 .
 7. Limitation of Liability
 Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
 negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
 distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
 direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
 character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
 goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
 commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of
 the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply
 to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's
 negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
 jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
 consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
 .
 8. Litigation
 Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
 jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
 such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
 reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
 prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
 .
 9. Miscellaneous
 This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
 hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
 provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
 enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
 contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
 this License against a Contributor.
 .

 CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
 LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
 ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION
 ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE
 USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND
 DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT
 OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
 .
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
 and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work
 of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
 the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
 fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
 other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
 whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
 purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the
 ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural
 and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
 their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or
 she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
 elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under
 its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those
 rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
 limited to, the following:
 .
 i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
 communicate, and translate a Work;
 .
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 .
 iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
 likeness depicted in a Work;
 .
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
 subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
 v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of
 data in a Work;
 .
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of
 the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
 protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
 including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
 .
 vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
 world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
 implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
 of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
 irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
 Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
 of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
 future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
 worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
 treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
 future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
 whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
 promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the
 benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of
 Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall
 not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
 any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of
 the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement
 of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
 be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
 Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
 account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
 extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
 person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non
 exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories
 worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
 treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
 future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
 whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
 promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed
 effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should
 any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
 ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
 ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and
 in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
 exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the
 Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with
 respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
 Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
 surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 .
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
 warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory
 or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
 merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
 the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
 absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
 extent permissible under applicable law.
 .
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
 persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
 limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
 Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
 consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
 .
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
 party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
 this CC0 or use of the Work.
